Tuenti Secrets-Manager

{{- if .Values.namespaceScopeEnabled }}
This deployment is scoped to the Namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}.
{{- else }}
This deployment is cluster-scoped and will watch for SecretDefinitions in all namespaces.
{{- end }}

You can map Vault secrets to Kubernetes Secrets as follows:
apiVersion: secrets-manager.tuenti.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretDefinition
metadata:
  name: sample
spec:
  # Add fields here
  name: sample-secrets
  keysMap:
    SECRET_KEY_!:
      path: secret/data/project/secret
      key: VAULT_SECRET_KEY_!
    SECRET_KEY_2:
      path: secret/data/project/secret
      key: VAULT_SECRET_KEY_2

This will create a Secret in the Kubernetes Namespace that the SecretDefinition is applied to.
If the deployment is namespace scoped then it will only work in the same namespace this Chart was deployed to.
The Vault secret path must be readable by the AppRole associated with the Chart deployment.
